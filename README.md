# üñäÔ∏è Arduino 2D Pen Plotter

A compact two-axis **Arduino-driven pen plotter** that draws shapes and text on paper using two stepper motors, timing belts, and a servo-controlled pen-lifting mechanism.

This project was developed as the **Individual Project** for the EPFL ‚ÄúMaking Intelligent Things‚Äù course (Spring 2025).  
It combines **mechanical design (CAD + laser cutting + 3D printing)** with **embedded control programming** on Arduino.

## ‚ú® Overview

The 2D Plotter translates digital drawings into physical motion through:
- **Two orthogonal linear axes** (X and Y) driven by 28BYJ-48 stepper motors via GT2 belts,  
- A **servo-actuated pen holder** for lift/lower control, and  
- An **Arduino Uno** that synchronizes both movements using the AccelStepper library.

## üß† Hardware Architecture

| Category | Component | Function |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Microcontroller** | Arduino Uno | Central controller for motion and servo commands |
| **Motors** | 2 √ó 28BYJ-48 5 V steppers | Drive X- and Y-axis movement |
| **Motor Drivers** | 2 √ó ULN2003 boards | Control signals from the Uno to the stepper coils |
| **Servo** | SG90 9 g servo | Raises and lowers the pen |
| **Transmission** | 2 √ó GT2 belts (40 cm & 62 cm) + 2 √ó GT2 pulleys (5 mm) | Belt-driven linear motion |
| **Structure** | Combination of laser-cut MDF parts and 3D-printed PETG components | Provides a stable and lightweight frame |
| **Power** | 5 V USB breakout board + micro-USB cable | Dedicated supply for motors and servo |

All grounds are common between Arduino, stepper drivers, and servo.  
External 5 V power avoids overloading the Arduino‚Äôs regulator.

## üß± Mechanical Design

The complete mechanical assembly is provided in [`/cad/design.step`](cad/design.step).

The pen holder uses a **spring-loaded sliding design**:  
when the servo moves down, the pen holder can **slide backward slightly** against the spring tension.  
This prevents excessive pressure on the pen tip and protects the servo gears from overload, ensuring smoother contact with the paper surface and more consistent line thickness during plotting.

## üíæ Programming Assignment 1 ‚Äî Square and Inscribed Circle

This is the **first programming assignment implemented for the Arduino 2D Pen Plotter project**.  
Its goal is to verify the synchronization of both stepper motors and demonstrate precise two-axis motion by drawing a **square followed by an inscribed circle**.

The code uses the [AccelStepper](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/) library in **FULL4WIRE mode** to drive two 28BYJ-48 motors via ULN2003 driver boards.  

| Section | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Config** | Defines motion parameters such as steps per side (`SIDE_STEPS = 4000`), motor directions (`DIR_X`, `DIR_Y`), and motion tuning (`MAX_SPEED`, `ACCEL`). |
| **Motors setup** | Two `AccelStepper` objects are created‚Äîone for each axis‚Äîwith pins matching the ULN2003 driver connections. |
| **`moveToXY_blocking()`** | Core function that performs synchronized absolute moves by calling `X.run()` and `Y.run()` until both reach target positions. |
| **`setup()`** | Initializes motors, sets speed/acceleration, resets positions, and executes the entire motion sequence: a square followed by an inscribed circle. |
| **`loop()`** | Empty ‚Äî all drawing occurs once during setup. |
